  "Project Overview and Objectives": [
    "Intelerad is responsible for providing all system, software, and other access requested by Kickdrum in order to complete the deliverables for all SOWs.",
    "Intelerad will provide infrastructure to the Kickdrum team in order to design, develop, build, deploy, and test deliverables.",
    "Kickdrum Technology Group will work with Intelerad teams to develop an AWS infrastructure capable of supporting the Ambra image storage solution, perform cost, usage, and customer analysis, implement one-time S3 bucketing and tagging, and support two phases of customer migrations.",
    "The project, Ambra Storage Migration, aims to migrate the primary image storage solution for Ambra, a service acquired by Intelerad, to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Currently, AWS is used by Ambra solely for disaster recovery purposes. The project does not include the migration of the database and related services, which will be covered in a separate Statement of Work.",
    "Throughout the project, Kickdrum may maintain relationships with Intelerad\u2019s partners and/or vendors in order to accomplish the goals of the project."
