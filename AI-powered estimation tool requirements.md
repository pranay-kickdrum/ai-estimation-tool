# AI-Powered Estimation Tool

# Problem statement

At Kickdrum, we work with multiple clients across diverse software projects. Before onboarding or signing any new work‚Äîespecially in the case of **fixed-bid engagements**‚Äîwe invest considerable effort in estimating the scope and effort required.

This estimation process involves reviewing **PRDs, technical documentation, and occasionally existing codebases** to define the work scope, break it down into deliverables, and forecast the required resources. It is typically handled by senior team members and consumes a significant number of **unbillable hours**, often before any revenue is secured.

As the demand for quick, accurate, and repeatable estimations grows, especially in competitive pre-sales environments, the inefficiencies in the current manual approach become more costly and unsustainable.

To streamline and standardize project estimation, we propose building an AI-powered internal tool that can assist in evaluating any new incoming work. Currently, estimations are manual, inconsistent, and heavily dependent on senior team members. This tool will analyze available inputs‚Äîsuch as documentation, requirements, and code‚Äîand generate a detailed work breakdown with initial time and effort estimates. By reducing reliance on individual judgment, it will enable faster, more consistent, and scalable estimations while saving valuable unbillable hours.

# ‚úÖ User Stories

* As a user, I want to upload a PRD and supporting documents so that the tool can analyze and extract relevant scope information.

* As a user, I want to connect a code repository so the tool can analyze the existing codebase for better technical estimation.

* As a user, I want to receive a detailed work breakdown so I can understand the scope of work at a granular level.

* As a user, I want the tool to generate initial time and effort estimates for each task so I can plan the project timeline.

* As a user, I want to view which tasks can be executed in parallel so I can plan team assignments more efficiently.

* As a user, I want to input the number of available team members and their roles so the tool can simulate sprint planning.

* As a user, I want to receive a sprint-wise deliverable plan so I can visualize project progress over time.

* As a user, I want to see the total estimated cost of the project based on the proposed team setup.

* As a user, I want to modify the team size or composition and instantly see how that impacts cost and timeline.

* As a user, I want to export the estimation report as a PDF or spreadsheet to share with stakeholders.

* As a user, I want to save and revisit past estimations so I can iterate or reuse them later.

* As a user, I want to compare multiple estimation versions to track how changes in scope or resources affect delivery.

* As a user, I want to regenerate the estimation after updating project documents or team inputs.

* As a user, I want a consistent estimation format for all projects so that stakeholders can easily understand and compare estimates.

* As a user, I want to integrate the estimation output with project management tools like Jira or Notion.

* As a user, I want to see confidence levels or risk flags on certain estimates so I can identify areas needing deeper review.

* As a user, I want the tool to learn from past estimation data to improve accuracy over time.

# Solution Approach: High-Level Technical Implementation

1. **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**

   * Build an interface to upload or link project artifacts such as PRDs, technical documents, design files, and code repositories.

   * Extract and preprocess content using OCR for scanned documents, parsers for code repositories, and NLP techniques to clean and summarize text data.

   * Generate semantic embeddings from the processed content to enable efficient querying and contextual understanding.

2. **Contextual Understanding & Work Breakdown Generation**

   * Use large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or GPT-4o to analyze inputs and identify key functional components, tasks, and dependencies.

   * Apply prompt engineering and chain-of-thought reasoning to break down high-level requirements into detailed work items and subtasks.

   * Optionally integrate frameworks like LangChain or LangGraph to orchestrate multi-step workflows, including document parsing, summarization, and task decomposition.

3. **Effort Estimation & Sprint Planning**

   * Develop an estimation engine powered by LLMs combined with internal heuristics or historical data to estimate time and effort for each work item.

   * Model team capacity by accepting inputs on team size, roles, and velocity, enabling the tool to generate sprint-wise deliverables and timelines.

   * Calculate potential parallelization of tasks to optimize scheduling and reduce overall project duration.

4. **Cost Simulation & What-If Analysis**

   * Link estimated effort with cost models based on team roles, hourly rates, and project constraints.

   * Provide a dynamic interface for users to tweak team compositions and immediately see updated cost and timeline projections.

   * Enable comparison between multiple scenarios for informed decision-making.

5. **Output Generation & Integration**

   * Generate structured reports, including work breakdown sheets, sprint plans, and cost estimates, exportable as PDF, CSV, or integrated with tools like Jira or Notion.

   * Implement version control for saved estimations to track changes over time and improve transparency.

6. **Continuous Learning & Improvement**

   * Collect feedback and actual delivery data to refine estimation accuracy using machine learning models or fine-tuning LLM prompts.

   * Maintain a knowledge base of past projects and estimations to improve future predictions and assist in standardizing estimations across the organization.

### **üîí On-Prem / VPC Deployment for Security-Conscious Clients**

To accommodate clients with strict data security and compliance requirements, the estimation tool can be deployed within the client‚Äôs own infrastructure‚Äîeither on-premise or inside their secure cloud environment (e.g., AWS VPC, Azure, GCP). This ensures that all sensitive assets‚Äîsuch as codebases, technical documents, and requirement specifications‚Äîremain entirely within the client‚Äôs network, with no data ever leaving their environment.

We can also integrate the tool with private or self-hosted LLMs (e.g., Azure OpenAI with data retention disabled, or open-source models like Mistral or LLaMA2 hosted via Ollama or vLLM). This allows for full AI-powered estimation workflows while preserving complete control over data privacy, auditability, and compliance.
